Material set textures

I didn't create these textures from scratch, therefore I won't claim copyright on them.

These textures were legally downloaded from "textures.com", and originally used in Tesseract. All used textures have been modified in GIMP 2.8, and/or ImageMagick. If other mappers can reuse them in their maps, they are most welcome to do so, no matter in what game.

To clear any possible misunderstanding, I'm mapper for several Cube GE based games, and I have habit of using different name for each game I play, both online and offline. In Sauerbraten my name is 7YearBitch (grunge band from Seattle), in Tesseract it's Suiseiseki (character from Rozenmaiden), in Valhalla it's Morti (character from .hack// light novels). There are other less known names as Kasadya and Rapedoll, but that's about it. I'm sokky for inconvenience... :)

Cheers, Morti
