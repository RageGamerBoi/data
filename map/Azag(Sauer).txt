About Map:
- Inspired by Quake and Lovecraft's stories. Quake 1 rocks!
- Main idea of this map is minimalism. I used only old diffuse textures and no mapmodels.
- Made with quick porting to Tesseract in mind, so lighting is medium quality in Sauerbraten.

Installation:
1) Locate your Sauerbraten folder:

    1b) Windows: C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\sauerbraten
