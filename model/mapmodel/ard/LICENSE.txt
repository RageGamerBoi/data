What license, lmao

Use these models however you please.

I would prefer you used them for Tesseract maps, otherwise I'll probably cry.

It is my view that Licenses hinder creativity.  Someone will have an awesome idea, only to be stopped by some retarded text on their screen.

"Oh but what if someone makes a million dollars from your work???"
Well, good for them, i don't care, and i'm glad i didn't stop their progress.
