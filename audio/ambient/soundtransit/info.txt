This is a sound used on the Cube 2: Sauerbraten map "Autumn"

I used this sound to enhance the atmosphere of the Tesseract Map "Turbine"

All credit for the Sound go to the original author "Soundtransit", or whoever made the sound.  I just found it in the folder and assumed his name is Soundtransit.
